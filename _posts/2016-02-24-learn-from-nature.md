**First production, then consumption.**

Every system does have its own inputs and outputs and basically, this is the nut. Building a new system costs resources. To expand your system, you first should consider to invest into assets which produce or save more resources. Very hard to focus on this when your head is full of ideas for the last minute.

For example, why to wait until a big tree will grow up (your perfect product) and leaving your garden unused? Grow something else what will not take so much time and will help you to get resources. 

[Pool your services][2] with others.

Use the space as effective as you can to get the most from your assets.
